## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

what i learned.. specially with li lists..

- How to align them
- How to color them
- How even can i place them side by side {this is specially at the last section}

with this i can grasp some knowledg with css psuedo element ::marker..

Like for example.. to color specifically..

```html
<h1>To color list items</h1>
<ul>
  <li class="list">numberone</li>
  <li class="list">numbertwo</li>
</ul>
```

```css
li.list::marker {
  color: red;
}
```

### Continued development

In the future i really want to focuse on simple projects that takes some javascript language.
